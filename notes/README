'yxg/notes/paper' is a submodule of the core repo 'yxg'.

It has been set up to link and sync changes in the local repo with Overleaf,
where the project 'paper' is hosted. In this way, we avoid pushing the entire repo to Overleaf every time, which contains files too large for Overleaf to handle.


=== SET UP ===

In order to make any changes to the paper, you should set up the link locally as a submodule. To do that, first clean up (or move to an outside backup directory) 'yxg/notes/paper/'.

* For example (running from the repo root folder 'yxg/'):
$ mv notes/paper/ ~/Desktop
$ git rm -r --cached notes/paper

* Then, again from the root folder run:
$ git submodule add --name paper https://git.overleaf.com/5bb5f3f767b04d11c24c5c9d notes/paper

* This will clone the contents of the Overleaf remote locally.

== PUSH CHANGES ==

Navigate to 'yxg/notes/paper'. This is a submodule whose remote is Overleaf. Push the changes to Overleaf.

* From the repo root directory:
$ cd notes/paper
$ git add <file>
$ git commit -m "<message>"
$ git push origin master

(Optional Step): Also push to GitHub. It is a good idea because others can see something has changed in the Overleaf remote before they start editing.

* From the repo root directory:
$ git add notes/paper
$ git commit -m "<message>"
$ git push origin master

== PULL CHANGES ==

Same principle as PUSH-ing changes. Everything has to be done from 'yxg/notes/paper'.

* From the repo root directory:
$ cd notes/paper
$ git pull origin master
